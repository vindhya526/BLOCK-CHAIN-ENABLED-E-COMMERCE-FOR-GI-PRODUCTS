The system uses blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger for GI-tagged products, ensuring authenticity and preventing counterfeiting.
Each GI-tagged product is assigned a unique QR code that links to its blockchain record, allowing consumers to easily verify the product's origin and production details through a simple scan.
Blockchain records all transactions and movements of the product through the supply chain, providing transparency and traceability from producer to consumer, and ensuring the integrity of the GI designation.
The system builds consumer trust by providing verifiable information about the product's authenticity and origin, while also enhancing engagement through transparent and accessible product histories.
