ABSTRACTION:
The system uses blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger for GI-tagged products, ensuring authenticity and preventing counterfeiting.
Each GI-tagged product is assigned a unique QR code that links to its blockchain record, allowing consumers to easily verify the product's origin and production details through a simple scan.
Blockchain records all transactions and movements of the product through the supply chain, providing transparency and traceability from producer to consumer, and ensuring the integrity of the GI designation.
The system builds consumer trust by providing verifiable information about the product's authenticity and origin, while also enhancing engagement through transparent and accessible product histories.

INTRODUCTION:
In the age of digital commerce, ensuring the authenticity and traceability of products, particularly those with Geographical Indication (GI) tags, has become paramount. 
GI-tagged products, known for their unique origin and traditional production methods, face significant challenges in maintaining authenticity and consumer trust in online markets. 
To address these issues, we propose a Blockchain-enabled QR verification system designed to enhance the transparency, security, and trustworthiness of GI-tagged products in e-commerce platforms.
Our approach combines blockchain technology with QR code verification. Each GI-tagged product receives a unique QR code linked to its blockchain record, ensuring transparency and authenticity. 
Blockchain's immutable ledger records all transactions and movements, providing a tamper-proof history of the product from producer to consumer. This system enhances supply chain transparency, combats counterfeiting, and allows consumers to easily verify product authenticity with a simple scan.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
This system aims to ensure the authenticity and traceability of GI-tagged products sold online using QR codes and blockchain technology.

Product Registration: Each GI-tagged product receives a unique identifier linked to its specific details (origin, production methods, etc.). 
This information is registered on a blockchain.

QR Code Generation: A unique QR code is generated that directly links to the product's record on the blockchain. 
This code is printed on the product's packaging.

Consumer Verification Process:
Customers scan the QR code on a GI-tagged product using their smartphone camera app.
The scan triggers an interaction with a blockchain verification app or website.
The app/website retrieves the product's information from the blockchain using the unique identifier embedded in the QR code.
Consumers are presented with details about the product's origin, production methods, and potentially even its journey through the supply chain (depending on the level of detail stored on the blockchain).
